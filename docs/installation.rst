Installation
============

This document describes the steps needed to install FeinCMS.

FeinCMS requires a working installation of Django_ version 1.7 or better
See the Django_ documentation for how to install and configure Django.

You can download a stable release of FeinCMS using ``pip``. Pip will install
feincms and its dependencies. Dependencies which are automatically installed
are: feedparser_, Pillow_ and django-mptt_. For outdated versions of
Django the best place to find supported combinations of library versions is the
`Travis CI build configuration
<https://github.com/feincms/feincms/blob/master/.travis.yml>`_.

    $ pip install feincms

In order to install documentation and tests install from the Git_ repository
instead::

    $ git clone git://github.com/feincms/feincms.git

If you are looking to implement a blog, check out elephantblog_.

You will also need a Javascript WYSIWYG editor of your choice (Not included).
TinyMCE_ and CKEditor_ work out of the box and are recommended.

Configuration
=============

There isn't much left to do apart from adding a few entries to
``INSTALLED_APPS``. Most commonly you'll want to add::

    feincms,
    mptt,
    feincms.module.page,
    feincms.module.medialibrary

Also, you should add the request context processor to the list of
``TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS``, the template tag and the administration
interface require it::

    django.core.context_processors.request

The customized administration interface needs some media and javascript
libraries which you have to make available to the browser. FeinCMS uses
Django's ``django.contrib.staticfiles`` application for this purpose. The media
files will be picked up automatically by the ``collectstatic`` management
command.

If your website is multi-language you have to define ``LANGUAGES`` in the
settings_.

Please note that the ``feincms`` module will not create or need any database
tables, but you need to put it into ``INSTALLED_APPS`` because otherwise the
templates in ``feincms/templates/`` will not be found by the template loader.

The tools contained in FeinCMS can be used for many CMS-related
activities. The most common use of a CMS is to manage a hierarchy of
pages and this is the most advanced module of FeinCMS too. Please
proceed to :ref:`page` to find out how you can get the page module
up and running.
