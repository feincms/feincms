====================================
FeinCMS 1.4 release notes (upcoming)
====================================

* FeinCMS supports more than one site from the same database with
  ``django.contrib.sites`` now. Thanks to Bojan Mihelac and Stephen Tyler
  for the work and insistence on this issue.

* It is possible to customize the administration model inline used for
  content types. This means that it's possible to customize more aspects
  of content type editing and to reuse more behaviors from Django itself,
  such as ``raw_id_fields``.

* Reusing the media library in your own content types has become much
  easier than before. When using a
  ``feincms.module.medialibrary.fields.MediaFileForeignKey`` instead of
  the standard ``django.db.models.ForeignKey`` and adding the media file
  foreign key to ``raw_id_fields``, you get the standard Django behavior
  supplemented with a thumbnail if the media file is an image.

* Support for the ``show_on_top`` option for the ``ItemEditor`` has been
  completely removed. This functionatliy has been deprecated since 1.2.

* FeinCMS 1.2 removed the CKEditor-specific rich text content in favor of a
  generalized rich text content supporting different rich text editors.
  Unfortunately the documentation and the available settings only reflected
  this partially. This has been rectified. Support for ``TINYMCE_JS_URL``,
  ``FEINCMS_TINYMCE_INIT_TEMPLATE`` and ``FEINCMS_TINYMCE_INIT_CONTEXT`` has
  been completely removed. The two settings ``FEINCMS_RICHTEXT_INIT_CONTEXT``
  and ``FEINCMS_RICHTEXT_INIT_TEMPLATE`` should be used instead. See the
  :ref:`contenttypes` documentation for more details.

* The two settings ``FEINCMS_MEDIALIBRARY_ROOT`` and
  ``FEINCMS_MEDIALIBRARY_URL`` have been removed. Their values always
  defaulted to ``MEDIA_ROOT`` and ``MEDIA_URL``. The way they were used
  made it hard to support other storage backends in the media library.
  If you still need to customize the storage class used in the media
  library have a look at ``MediaFile.reconfigure``.

* FeinCMS has gained support for ``django-reversion``.
