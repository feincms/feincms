FeinCMS 1.11 release notes (upcoming)
=====================================

Welcome to FeinCMS 1.11!


Template inheritance with application contents
==============================================

FeinCMS adds a decorator and a ``TemplateResponse`` subclass which can be
returned from apps embedded through ``ApplicationContent``. The template
response's template will override the template used by FeinCMS' main view and
the context will be merged. A selection of HTTP response headers
(currently *Cache-Control*, *Last-Modified* and *Expires*) will also be copied
to the main response. The following two examples are fully equivalent::

    from django.template.response import TemplateResponse
    from feincms.content.application.models import UnpackTemplateResponse
    from feincms.views.decorators import unpack

    @unpack
    def app_detail(request, ...):
        return TemplateResponse(request, 'template.html', {...})

    # or

    def app_detail(request, ...):
        return UnpackTemplateResponse(request, 'template.html', {...})

The response class can also be easily used with Django's class-based views::

    class MyListView(generic.ListView):
        response_class = UnpackTemplateResponse

This mechanism supersedes returning a tuple of ``(template_name, context)``.
This is still supported, but lacks the possibility to override HTTP response
headers.


Backwards-incompatible changes
==============================

* FeinCMS requires a minimum of Django 1.6.

* The example project has been removed, because it did not really demonstrate
  a best practices FeinCMS setup. A standard installation of FeinCMS will
  often include additional libraries such as
  `feincms-oembed <https://github.com/feincms/feincms-oembed>`_,
  `form-designer <https://github.com/feincms/form_designer>`_ and additional
  modules.


Removal of deprecated features
------------------------------

There were no deprecated features to be removed.


New deprecations
================

* ``RSSContent`` and ``update_rsscontent`` have been deprecated, those being
  the only reason why ``FeinCMS`` depends on ``feedparser``. This will allow
  us to remove this dependency. Users should switch to
  `feincms-syndication <https://github.com/feincms/feincms-syndication>`_
  instead.

* The automatic discovery of subclasses of ``NavigationExtension`` has been
  replaced with an explicit mechanism of defining navigation extensions.


Notable features and improvements
=================================

* Fix the inconsistent filtering of pages inside ``feincms_nav``. Navigation
  extensions always came last, but the last release of FeinCMS added navigation
  group filtering afterwards. This has been fixed. The workaround for the
  previous behavior was to add the matching navigation group to page pretenders
  as well.

* Support for importing PIL as `import Image` has been removed.


Bugfixes
========

* ``{% feincms_nav %}`` now filters by navigation group before applying navigation
  extensions for internal consistency.

* ``{% page_is_active %}`` correctly handles page pretenders now.


Compatibility with Django and other apps
========================================

FeinCMS 1.11 requires Django 1.6 or better.
