====================================
FeinCMS 1.6 release notes (upcoming)
====================================

Welcome to FeinCMS 1.6!


Backwards-incompatible changes
==============================


Reversing application content URLs
----------------------------------

The default value of ``FEINCMS_REVERSE_MONKEY_PATCH`` has been changed to
``False``. Support for monkey-patching the ``reverse()`` method to support
the old ``'urlconf/viewname'`` notation will be removed in the 1.7 release.


Improvements to the bundled file and image contents
---------------------------------------------------

* ``ImageContent``, ``FileContent`` and ``VideoContent`` now have pretty
  icons out-of-the-box.

* ``ImageContent`` now accepts optional ``FORMAT_CHOICES`` for use with
  FeinCMS' bundled thumbnailers, as well as ``caption`` and ``alt_text`` fields.

  .. note::

     If you are upgrading from an earlier version of FeinCMS, you'll have to
     add the new database columns yourself or use a migration tool like South
     to do it for you. Instructions for MySQL and the page module follow::

         ALTER TABLE page_page_imagecontent ADD COLUMN `alt_text` varchar(255) NOT NULL;
         ALTER TABLE page_page_imagecontent ADD COLUMN `caption` varchar(255) NOT NULL;

     If you want to use ``FORMAT_CHOICES``::

         ALTER TABLE page_page_imagecontent ADD COLUMN `format` varchar(64) NOT NULL;

* ``FileContent`` now displays the size of the file in the default template,
  and uses ``span`` elements to allow styling of the title / size.


Removal of deprecated features
------------------------------

* Deprecated page manager methods have been removed. You should use
  ``Page.objects.for_request`` instead of the following manager methods:

  * ``Page.objects.page_for_path_or_404()``
  * ``Page.objects.for_request_or_404()``
  * ``Page.objects.best_match_for_request()``
  * ``Page.objects.from_request()``

* Deprecated page methods have been removed:

  * ``Page.active_children()``: Use ``Page.children.active()`` instead.
  * ``Page.active_children_in_navigation()``: Use
    ``Page.children.in_navigation()`` instead.
  * ``Page.get_siblings_and_self()``: You probably wanted
    ``self.parent.children.active()`` or
    ``self.get_siblings(include_self=True).active()`` anyway.

* The shortcuts ``Page.register_request_processors()`` and
  ``Page.register_response_processors()`` to register several request or response
  processors at once have been removed in favor of their counterparts which
  only allow one processor at a time, but allow for replacing FeinCMS' included
  processors, ``require_path_active_request_processor`` and
  ``redirect_request_processor``.

* It is not possible anymore to access the request and response processors as
  methods of the ``Page`` class. The processors are all in
  ``feincms.module.page.processors`` now.

* The deprecated support for prefilled attributes has been removed. Use
  Django's own ``prefetch_related`` or ``feincms.utils.queryset_transform``
  instead.

* The deprecated ``feincms.views.base`` module has been removed. The code has
  been moved to ``feincms.views.legacy`` during the FeinCMS v1.5 cycle.


Notable features and improvements
=================================

* The bundled content types take additional steps to ensure that the main view
  context is available in content types' templates. If you only use the rendering
  tags (``feincms_render_region`` and ``feincms_render_content``) you can take
  advantage of all variables from your context processors in content types'
  templates too.

* ``MediaFile`` does no longer auto-rotate images on upload. It really is not a
  media library's job to magically modify user content; if needed, it should be
  done in an image filter (like sorl). Also, reading through the image data
  seems to have a side effect on some external storage engines which then would
  only save half the image data, see issue #254. Additionally, FeinCMS does not
  try anymore to detect whether uploaded files really are images, and only looks
  at the file extension by default. We did not peek at the contents of other file
  types either.

* A new model field has been added, ``feincms.contrib.richtext.RichTextField``.
  This is a drop-in replacement for Django's ``models.TextField`` with the
  difference that it adds the CSS classes required by rich text fields in the
  item editor.

* The value of ``FEINCMS_FRONTEND_EDITING`` defaults to ``False`` now.

* The ``SectionContent`` content type has been updated and does properly
  use ``raw_id_fields`` for the media files instead of the hack which was used
  before.

* Thumbnails generated by the bundled ``|thumbnail`` and ``|cropscale`` template
  filters are stored separately from the uploaded files now. This change means
  that all thumbnails will be automatically regenerated after a FeinCMS update.
  If you need the old behavior for some reason, set the setting
  ``FEINCMS_THUMBNAIL_DIR`` to an empty string. The default setting is ``'_thumbs/'``.


Bugfixes
========

* The core page methods support running with ``APPEND_SLASH = False`` now.
  Many content types using forms do not, however.
