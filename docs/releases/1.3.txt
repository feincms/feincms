====================================
FeinCMS 1.3 release notes (upcoming)
====================================


Overview
========

FeinCMS 1.3 is mainly a cleanup release and does not sport many new features.


Changes and highlights
======================

* The default ``ContentProxy`` has been rewritten to load all content type
  instances on initialization. The instances stay around for the full
  request-response cycle which allows us to remove many quasi-global variables
  (variables attached to the ``request`` object). The new initialization is
  much more efficient in terms of SQL queries needed; the implementation is
  contained inside the ``ContentProxy`` class and not distributed all over
  the place.

* Content types can specify the media files (Javascript and CSS files) they
  need to work correctly. See :ref:`contenttypes-extramedia` for information
  on how to use this in your own content types.

* The ``ContactFormContent`` has been updated to take advantage of the
  new content type interface where content types can influence the
  request-response cycle in more ways. See :ref:`contenttypes-processfinalize`
  for more information.

* The ``ct_tracker`` extension has been rewritten to take advantage of the
  new ``ContentProxy`` features. This means that the format of ``_ct_inventory``
  could not be kept backwards compatible. Because of this you have to empty
  the ``_ct_inventory`` fields yourself on upgrading::

      $ ./manage.py shell
      >>> from feincms.module.page.models import Page
      >>> Page.objects.all().update(_ct_inventory=None)

* Application contents do not use global state (state stored on the ``request``
  object) as much as before anymore. The ``ContentProxy`` refactoring allows us
  to store the needed data directly on the application content instance itself.

* ``feincms_site`` is not available in the context anymore. It was undocumented,
  mostly unused and badly named anyway. If you still need this functionality you
  should use ``django.contrib.sites`` directly yourself.

* The ``_feincms_appcontent_parameters`` has been folded into the
  ``_feincms_extra_context`` attribute on the current request. The
  ``appcontent_parameters`` template tag is not necessary anymore
  (the content of ``_feincms_extra_context`` is guaranteed to be available in
  the template context) and has been removed.

* As part of the effort to reduce variables attached to the request object
  (acting as a replacement for global variables), ``request.extra_path``
  has been removed. The same information can be accessed via
  ``request._feincms_extra_context['extra_path']``.
