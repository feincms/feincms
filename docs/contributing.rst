Repository branches
===================

The FeinCMS repository on github has several branches. Their purpose and
rewinding policies are described below.

* ``maint``: Maintenance branch for the second-newest version of FeinCMS.
* ``master``: Stable version of FeinCMS.

``master`` and ``maint`` are never rebased or rewound.

* ``next``: Upcoming version of FeinCMS. This branch is rarely rebased
  if ever, but this might happen. A note will be sent to the official
  mailing list whenever ``next`` has been rebased.
* ``pu`` or feature branches are used for short-lived projects. These
  branches aren't guaranteed to stay around and are not meant to be
  deployed into production environments.
